                        <p class="ba-about__text">Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having the
                            right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very powerful.
                            They are capable of influencing every aspect of our daily lives, from our physical health to
                            our social behaviors. I’m sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.”

                            If we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts. Harnessing the power of
                            thought in a positive way has the ability to create great change in our lives, including our
                            financial well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as intangible as
                            thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?

                            We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having a lot of money.
                            Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering
                            this train of thought is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it
                            consistently.

                            Following are some ideas to help you improve your thoughts, and ultimately attract more
                            prosperity into your life:

                            Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few minutes each day to express
                            heartfelt gratitude for the good things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of
                            these blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right direction — on
                            abundance, not lack.

                            Use positive affirmations to begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am”
                            statements such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements down and repeat
                            them nightly before bed. Over time, this will implant these thoughts into your subconscious
                            mind, and you will begin to naturally believe them.

                            Creative visualization can help you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
                            achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind. This works in the same way
                            affirmations do. Our subconscious will fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these
                            subconscious “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being prosperous, and
                            you will become so.

                            Encourage yourself with the belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one
                            of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a certain salary, tell
                            yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to believe all things are possible, and you will
                            gain the confidence needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you believe
                            you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks associated with people who are highly
                            successful. Prosperity and success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher.

                            Start a savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like Attracts Like. Even
                            if you can only afford to put a few dollars into your account every month, it will begin to
                            build up and attract more money.

                            Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The creative ability of our thoughts is such that
                            we lend more power and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack will
                            create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will create . . . guess what?

                            Remember that this is a process. You likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But
                            over time, with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what you want. Once
                            you master this power of thought, there are truly no limits to what you can create!</p>

                        <p class="ba-about__text">Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look at
                            the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising network may help.

                            Recognition can be illustrated by two individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both
                            walk to the far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily and unnoticed
                            as they reach the far side. The second person takes much longer to reach the far side
                            because they are engaged in conversations along the way as they continue to meet
                            acquaintances and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like to model
                            your business after?

                            Your business is in a continual battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it
                            or not. If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with very few
                            competitors, that will not last for long. You need your business to be at the forefront of
                            your client’s minds so that when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
                            people.

                            Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name and logo out there and keeping it
                            there is a must. This lets clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
                            Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in recognition. I am reminded of
                            both television and radio ads I had heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch
                            phrase or musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television until you are
                            absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get it out of your head. Although this type
                            of advertising is expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is quite
                            high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and they are broad in their appeal.
                            In a brief sentence, you are paying to market to both those that are your potential
                            customers and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never will be your
                            customers.

                            There are more economical ways to pursue frequency, the point is to define your target
                            market demographic, and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best be
                            seen by them.

                            Another factor to consider is “can I market myself in a place where I will stand out from my
                            competition, or where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you market
                            yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your competition and risk blending into a
                            crowd, and ultimately being ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
                            saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you look at your advertising
                            budget for the year, try to find the affordable solutions that will continue to reap during
                            the full year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television promotion may
                            give short term gains for that weekend sale, but what about the rest of the year? Your
                            clients may end up with the impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard
                            anything about them for so long.

                            Don’t always look for the old standbys in marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for
                            the latest and greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of technology coming
                            down dramatically new options such as digital advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are
                            becoming more and more affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing of
                            the past. With the flexibility, and curb appeal of full color and motion video footage with
                            computer generated graphics available to you, this is an option you don’t want to pass by
                            without a good look. Ultimately, recognition is required if you want to get people “in the
                            door” of your business (or on your website for the new e-businesses). This is going to cost
                            you money, time and effort up front any way that you look at it, but if you have
                            successfully reached your target market, the payoffs will be worth it.</p>
